## Hi! I'm Jennifer {.tabset .tabset-pills}


### About Me/Contact



I'm a PhD Candidate in Epidemiology at the University of California Berkeley. I use mathematical and statistical models to understand the impact of public health policies, climate, and individual behaviors on infectious disease dynamics. I particularly focus on emerging, environmentally-mediated, or zoonotic diseases. My work utilizes both large surveillance datasets, as well as primary data collected from household questionnaires, anthrompometric measurements, and serosurveys. I think of myself first as an epidemiologist, but my work and methods cross multiple disciplines, including data science, econometrics, environmental health, and ecology.
