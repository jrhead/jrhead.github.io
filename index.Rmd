CSI-Michigan is an interdisciplinary research group located within the Department of Epidemiology at the University of Michigan. Our group applies mathematical and statistical models to understand the impact of climate, public health policies, and individual behaviors on infectious disease dynamics. A major focus of our work is on the emergence of fungal infections, including Valley fever (also known as coccidioidomycosis), blastomycosis, and histoplasmosis. Our work and methods cross multiple disciplines, including epidemiology, data science, econometrics, environmental health, and ecology. We collaborate with state and federal agencies to help convey findings into actionable public health outcomes.

**The emergence of Valley fever in a changing climate**

<img align="right" src="BioR_VFspores.png" alt="My Image" width = 30% height = 30%>

Coccidioidomycosis, also called Valley fever, is a fungal disease caused by inhalation of soil-dwelling spores endemic to the southwestern US. Incidence has been increasing markedly in the American southwest, and environmental factors are likely at play. We work with the Remais and Taylor lab at UC Berkeley, recipients of an NIH R01 project, ["Integrating epidemiologic and environmental approaches to understand and predict Coccidioides exposure and coccidioidomycosis emergence"](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/rJKT6hvETUy8suWJ0QN6nA/project-details/10065493) to addresses gaps in our understanding of the kinds of dust exposures, and the environmental and social conditions, that increase the incidence of coccidioidomycosis in the southwest. We are examining the role of environmental conditions -- like drought and wildfires --  in the geographic expansion of the pathogen.

**Distribution of human-pathogenic fungi in environmental media (soil, air, zoonotic hosts)**

<img align="right" src="D8H_9187.jpg" alt="My Image" width=30% height=30%>

*Coccidioides*, the fungal pathogen that causes Valley fever, grows in the soil and becomes airborne. We are examining climate and zoonotic factors that influence its presence in soil and dispersal through air. Rodents may play an important role in the lifecycle of the *Coccidioides* fungus. We are conducting longitudinal soil surveillance within burrows and surface soils within the Carrizo Plain, in areas with rodents and without. The Carrizo Plain is endemic for the pathogen as well as home to a large population of the endangered kangaroo rat. This project was started under an NIH F31 grant, ["Elucidating the role of rodent hosts on transmission of coccidiodomycosis in California"](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/rQH2DRMYj0CoV0qQ0RiNIg/project-details/10216947). 
Separately, we are working with the US EPA to understand *Coccidioides* airborne dispersal using Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). By affixing portable air sampling devices to uncrewed aircraft systems, we can detect aerosolized *Coccidioides* spores across a variety of landscapes and hard-to-reach locations, while simulataneously collected detailed geospatial information.

Bats are known hosts for *Histoplasma* spp., a fungal pathogens that cause histoplasmosis, and - to a lesser degree - can be infected with *Blastomyces* spp., a fungal pathogen that causes blastomycosis. Outbreaks of histoplasmosis are often associated with caves and bat guano, but it is unclear whether bats are carrying the fungus and depositing it via their feces or merely providing the proper nutrients for the fungus to grow in soils. We are investigating the distribution of *Histoplasma* and *Blastomyces* species in bats in Michigan.

**Population immunity to Valley fever and other endemic mycoses**

<img align="right" src="VFVaccine.jpg" alt="My Image" width=30% height=30%>

Despite its changing epidemiology, our most recent knowledge of immunity to Valley fever and other fungal infections is based on surveys from 1951. Cases ascertained by surveillance systems are believed to vastly undercount true incidence: CDC estimates nearly 150,000 cases of coccidioidomycosis go uncounted each year. Dr. Head is a recipient of an NIH K01 grant, "Modelled estimation of population immunity for coccidioidomycosis and the role of immunologically naive populations in the shifting epidemiology of coccidioidomycosis in California" to address this gap. This project will also develop new models to evaluate how population movement biases residence-based measures of association.

Incidence of Valley fever is disproportionately high among incarcerated populations. As part of this project, the group is also working with California Correctional Health Care Services to examine risk factors for the transmission of Valley fever and evaluate preventative measures among California's incarcerated residents.

**Climate and other emerging fungal infections: histoplasmosis and blastomycosis**
<img align="right" src="histo.png" alt="My Image" width = 30% height = 30%>

Fungal infections endemic to the Midwest and eastern parts of the US include histoplasmosis and blastomycosis. These diseases may also be climate-sensitive and are changing their spatial distribution. Dr. Head is a co-I on an NIH R01 project to investigate the relationship between climatic factors and other fungal infections, leveraging massive electronic health record and Medicare datasets.

**COVID-19 transmission in pediatric populations**

<img align="right" src="BioR_COVID.png" alt="My Image" width = 25% height = 25%>

Our group is interested in a variety of emerging infectious diseases. We are working with the California Department of Public Health to understand the influence of public health policies in schools on transmission attributable to in-person schooling. We use mathematical models and econometric designs to understand transmission dynamics. Some published modeling work can be seen [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2021.100133) and [here](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.0970). We are also working to understand impact of pediatric vaccines on childhood COVID-19 rates.
